/**
 * @brief String manipulation module
 * @details The strings are a maximum of 255 bytes long and are null terminated. The null character 
 * makes the interal storage a max of 256 bytes.  For strings 256 bytes and longer,
 * these macros can be repeated for each set of 256 bytes.
 *
 * String addresses can be absolute addresses or post-indexed indirect, "(Zero-Page), Y".
 * To be clear, if passing a zero-page address, it is implied that the address is an
 * indirect address that will be post-indexed by Y by the macro.  So, the zero page 
 * address will hold the absolute address (small endian) of the string.
 * Only pass the zero-page address without brackets, such as $FA.  Last usable zero-page
 * address for post-indexed indirect addressing mode is $FE, so do not pass $FF.
 *
 * Numeric parameters must be an address.  That is, store the number in an address (zero-page
 * or 16-bit) and then pass the address to the parameter.  In the comments, these parameters 
 * will be dereferenced by the *, as in C notation.  For example, numChars is the address, and
 * numChars is the value stored at address numChars.
 *
 * Notes:
 * When a post condition is that the carry is set, a programmer can repeat these macros 
 * for strings 256 chars or longer.  The programmer would call the macros as many times 
 * as the number of 256-byte strings needed for memory allocation of the string. 
 * In this way, a programmer can create a string data type with length longer than 255.  
 * In this case, multiple 256-byte strings could be used to represent a long string, with 
 * each 256-byte string holding 256 characters, excluding the terminator (#0), except for 
 * the last byte 256-byte string which must be terminated at 255.
 *
 * Examples will be given in the official documentation.
